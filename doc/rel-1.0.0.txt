Hi all,

execnet enables zero-install ad-hoc instantiation of local or remote
Python processes.  It establishes channels for basic data communication.
Data Serialization is independent from Pickle and is tested between 
Python2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1 and Jython interpreters.  

execnet-1.0.0 (compared to 1.0.0b3) has bug fixes, new tested
examples and introduces execnet.Group for managing a dynamic
bunch of hosts.  See the improved docs

    http://codespeak.net/execnet/

and below the changelog.  I am set to improve and develop
execnet further and thus am very interested in feedback
and suggestions. 

cheers,
holger
