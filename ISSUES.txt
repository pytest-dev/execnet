rsync links from posix to windows

bb: http://bitbucket.org/hpk42/py-trunk/issue/35

currently rsyncing bails out with a strange message when trying to rsync
links. should provide better message or even some support for doing it.

http process for mediating client/remote-subprocess execution
------------------------------------------------------------------

tags: 1.2 feature newdist

A client client connects to an http-execserver.  An http-execserver
routes incoming "POST /exec" requests to a subprocess and returns a PID.
The PID identifies the subprocess which is used for further communication.

Client             http-exec              subprocess

makegw("...") ->   POST /popen     ->     Popen() with bootstrap
                   (bootstrap)
                   <- PID

c=rexec(...)       POST /exec/PID         exec source
(source)

c.send(1)          POST /exec/PID         x = c.receive()
                   (1)                    assert x == 1
                                          c.send(2)

z = c.receive()    GET /exec/PID
                   <- (2)
assert z == 2

The client connects via "POST /exec/PID"
and pushes data to the remotely-executing code
in the subprocess.

The client connects via "GET /exec/PID"
and receives data from the remotely-executing code.

The client constructs a Channel() object which triggers
these two connections, presenting a nice send/receive
abstractions.

The code executing in the http-execserver controled
subprocess is a PopenGateway.  It does not know that it
is connected via the http client/server machinery.

The http-execserver proxies data from the subprocess
to the client.  If there is no active GET request, the
data is queued.

The http-execserver forwards data from the client to the
subprocess, using the PID.  If the subprocess is not
connected, an ERROR code is returned.

Example session:

    gw = group.makegateway("http=codespeak.net")

    def fun(channel):
        return channel.send(channel.receive()+1)

    ch = gw.remote_exec(fun)
    ch.send(1)
    x = ch.receive()
    assert x == 2


a channel-IO based gateway
--------------------------------------------------
tags: 1.1 feature newdist

A building block for establishing a permanent hierarchy
of processes is a Gateway that operates on a Channel object.
This way a gateway can be instantiated through another
intermediating gateway which bi-directionallry forwads
Messages through a existing channel.

A code example could look like this:

    group.setlocalfactory(port=8888)
    gw = group.makegateway("ssh=codespeak.net")
    # local ssh-process would be a child of the factory service
    # which could have timeouts for killing, or allow resuming.
    # for instantiating remote it could also install a multiplexer
    # on the remote place such that the same ssh connection is re-used
    # for multiple ssh=codespeak.net connections, makes for small latency.

some first simple implemenation might look like this::

    gw = group.makegateway("socketservice//port=8888")
    # we can rely that the subprocess gw can import execnet
    ch = gw.remote_exec("""
        import execnet.service
        execnet.service.gatewaymaker(channel)
    """)
    ch.send(xspec)
    subchannel = ch.receive()
    return ChannelGateway(subchannel)

creating virtualenv environments on the fly
-----------------------------------------------
tags: 1.1 wish

there should be a (plugin-provided?) way to create
a virtual environment:
    gw = makegateway("ssh=codespeak.net")
    newgw = xdeploy.create_venv_gateway(gw, "venvname", depstring)
    newgw # lives in home/ dir of remote virtualenv
          # maybe have get_temproot default to tmp/ there?
    sf = xdeploy.SetupFile("..setup.py")
    sf.sdist_remote_install(newgw)


have callback accept errors / errback
-----------------------------------------------
tags: 1.1 wish

If using channel.setcallback() it currently is not
possible to notice the exact errors that might happen
on the other side.  Either introduce an "errback"
or (probably better) optionally allow an extra 'error'
parameter to execnet callbacks.

fix rsync between python/jython
-----------------------------------------------
tags: 1.0 bug

rsync does not complete with jython.
